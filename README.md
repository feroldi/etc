# Dots

These are my configuration files (oh my dotfiles). I need them to live.
I've put it here so that I won't lost it.

Feel free to ask, contact me, fork, anything.

# Dependencies

I might be forgetting a few ones.

    rxvt-unicode, xsel, siji fonts, bitmap fonts, xdotool, sxhkd, jshon

* TODO: Tree of all scripts and their respective dependencies.

# Install

I keep a script to link all my dotfiles to `$HOME`, in `scripts/dotlink.sh`.
Just run it and you are good.

Note that there is my .gitconfig, so I highly recommend you to not run my `dotlink.sh` (unless you edit it).

# License

Why would I need a license for this?
