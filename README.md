# Dots

These are my configuration files (oh my dotfiles). I need
them in order to live.

Feel free to ask, contact me, fork, anything.

# Dependencies

I might be forgetting a few ones.

    rxvt-unicode, xclip, sxhkd, jshon, muxx

# Install

See thelostt/bin/scripts/dotlink.sh

Note that there is my .gitconfig, so I highly recommend you to not run my `dotlink.sh` blindly.
